## Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Dataset contains body parameters collected by wearable applicances on 30 subjects from performing 6 activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. Output is a clean dataset that has subject ID, activity ID, and the means of 86 biometric records for each individual on each activitiy, i.e. 180 rows of records. 

## Procedures performed on original dataset:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, i.e. WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, i.e. removed unnecessary dots and spaces and duplicate strings.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
